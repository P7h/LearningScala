# LearningScala

----------

## Introduction
Scala Playground -- examples and snippets for learning Scala.

* [Atomic Scala](http://www.atomicscala.com/) -- Bruce Eckel and Dianne Marsh
* [Scala for the impatient](http://www.horstmann.com/scala/index.html) -- Cay Horstmann

## Motivation
These days [almost] every framework for Big Data processing is written in Scala language.<br>
Few examples: Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Samza, Scalding and SummingBird to name a few.<br>
My primary motivation to learn Scala is to learn Apache Spark [and its built-in libraries] and Kafka.<br>
I feel that this will help me in future if I can inculcate functional programming principles as well during my Scala learning.<br>
The initial plan is to start with Atomic Scala then move to Scala for the Impatient and finally to PinS.<br>

After I am done with the first 2 books, I am planning to take Martin Odersky's Coursera course "Functional Programming in Scala". I tried taking that course many times before, but due to some or other commitments, it always went to backburner. And this time, I will look into the archive and plan to complete the course without the certificate after I am done with Atomic Scala and Scala for the Impatient. :sweat: <br>

## Environment
Initially all the samples and exercises of Atomic Scala were developed and tested using Scala v2.10.4 [as Apache Spark releases its binaries compatible with this version as of December, 2014].<br>
AS of 23rd Jan, I left Atomic Scala and moved on Scala for the Impatient, as I dint get the feel that I am learning fast enough with Atomic Scala book.<br>
