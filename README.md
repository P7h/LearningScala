# LearningScala
=============

## Introduction
Scala Playground -- examples and snippets for learning Scala

* [Atomic Scala](http://www.atomicscala.com/)
* [Scala for the impatient](http://www.horstmann.com/scala/index.html)

## Motivation
These days [in 2014], [almost] every framework for Big Data processing is written in Scala.<br>
Few examples, Scalding, Spark, Kafka, Samza and SummingBird to name a few.<br>
My primary motivation to learn Scala is to learn Spark and Kafka.<br>
I feel that this will help me in future if I can inculcate Functional Programming principles.<br>
The initial plan is to start with Atomic Scala then move to Scala for the Impatient and finally to PinS.<br>
After I am done with the first 2 books, I am planning to take Martin Odersky's Coursera course "Functional Programming in Scala". I tried taking that course many times before, but due to some or other commitments, it always went to backburner. I will look into the archive and plan to complete the course with the certificate immediately after I am done with Atomic Scala and Scala for the Impatient. :sweat: <br>

## Environment
Initially all the samples and exercises of Atomic Scala were deveoped and tested using Scala v2.10.4.<br>
